## Project Overview
**MarketPredictor** leverages machine learning algorithms such as **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM** networks to predict stock prices and trends. The project uses historical stock market data (open, close, high, low, and volume) to train the model, forecast future trends, and visualize the performance.

The projectâ€™s primary goal is to provide a useful tool for stock market prediction using AI and Machine Learning, helping both beginners and experienced traders make better decisions.

## Features
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze and visualize stock price trends.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of machine learning models using various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, etc.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Generate real-time stock predictions.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides interactive charts to help visualize stock performance.

## Installation

To run **MarketPredictor** on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MarketPredictor.git
   cd MarketPredictor
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   - First, make sure you have `Python 3.x` installed.
   - Then, install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   You can create a virtual environment for better dependency management:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: To start the project, ensure that you have the required stock market data (historical stock prices). You can download it from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

2. **Training the Model**: To train the machine learning model on the stock data, run the following:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Making Predictions**: After training the model, you can make predictions using:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --stock_symbol <symbol> --days <forecast_days>
   ```

   Replace `<symbol>` with the stock ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL`, `GOOG`) and `<forecast_days>` with the number of days you want to predict.

4. **Visualizing Results**: To visualize the predictions:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```

5. **Real-time Prediction**: For making real-time stock predictions, the `predict_live.py` script fetches the latest stock data and gives predictions based on the trained model.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: For creating visualizations and stock price trend charts.
- **Yahoo Finance API/Alpha Vantage API**: For fetching stock data.

## Data Sources
- The stock data is obtained through APIs such as [Yahoo Finance](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/) or [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).
- You can also use CSV files containing historical stock prices available on public platforms or financial websites.

## Modeling Approach
- **Data Preprocessing**: The stock data undergoes preprocessing, such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Models such as **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) are used to predict stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using performance metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
